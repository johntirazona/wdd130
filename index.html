            Hi! My Name is John Jenly Tirazona. I'm from Manila, Philippines. 
            and I am a student of BYU Pathway Worldwide, currently studying Software Development.
            I chose this program to build a strong foundation in technology and problem-solving, 
            with the goal of creating meaningful and efficient digital solutions.
            Through BYU Pathway’s flexible and spiritually uplifting environment,
            I’m developing both technical skills and personal values that will help me 
            succeed in the tech industry and serve others in the process.
